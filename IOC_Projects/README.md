# IOC Projects

This repository contains comprehensive Spring Core (IOC) concept-based mini-projects demonstrating various types of Dependency Injection, IOC design patterns, and advanced Spring container features.

---

## üîß **Core DI Concepts**
- **Setter Injection**: Using `@Autowired` annotation over setter methods
- **Constructor Injection**: Using `@Autowired` annotation over constructors  
- **Field Injection**: Using `@Autowired` annotation directly on fields
- **Ambiguity Resolution**: Resolving bean injection ambiguity using `@Qualifier`, `@Primary`, or `primary="true"` in XML-based configuration
- **Dependency Injection (Maven Project)**: Demonstrating DI using a Maven-based setup

---

## üé® **Design Pattern Projects**
- **Factory Pattern**: Object creation using the Factory design pattern in a Spring context
- **Strategy Pattern**: Dynamic behavior injection using Strategy design pattern
- **Strategy Pattern with Properties**: Strategy pattern implementation using externalized configuration
- **Strategy Pattern with Spring**: Strategy pattern implementation managed via Spring container

---

## üöÄ **Realtime & Advanced DI**
- **Realtime DI Test Project**: Mini-project simulating a real-world DI use case using Spring
- **Realtime Student Registration**: Simulated registration flow using Spring beans and injection
- **Student Registration with Mystyle**: Customized registration logic with Spring
- **Bean Aliasing**: Use of aliases for beans using `@AliasFor` and XML aliases
- **Circular Injection**: Identifying and handling circular dependency injection issues in Spring

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è **Bean Scopes & Internationalization**
- **IOCProj16_SingletonClass&SpringBeanScope**: Singleton patterns and Spring bean scope management
- **IOCProj17_Spring_I18n**: Internationalization (i18n) implementation with Spring framework

---

## üîÑ **Bean Lifecycle Management (LCM)**
- **IOCProj18_LCMDeclarativeApproach**: Declarative approach to bean lifecycle management
- **IOCProj19_LCMProgramaticApproach**: Programmatic approach to bean lifecycle management
- **IOCProj20_LCMAnnotationApproach**: Annotation-based approach to bean lifecycle management
- **IOCProj21_LCMAllThreeAproaches**: Comprehensive comparison of all three lifecycle management approaches

---

## üîç **Dependency Lookup Patterns**
- **IOCProj22_TraditionalDependencyLookup**: Traditional dependency lookup implementation and challenges
- **IOCProj23_TraditionalDependencyLookupSoln**: Solutions and best practices for dependency lookup

---

## üåü **Key Features Covered**
- All types of Dependency Injection (Constructor, Setter, Field)
- Bean scope management and lifecycle control
- Internationalization and localization support
- Design pattern implementation with Spring
- Circular dependency resolution strategies
- Bean aliasing and naming conventions
- Lifecycle management approaches (Declarative, Programmatic, Annotation-based)
- Traditional dependency lookup vs. modern DI patterns
- Real-world application scenarios and best practices

---

## üìã **Prerequisites**
- Java 8+
- Spring Framework Core
- Maven/Gradle
- Eclipse/IntelliJ IDE
- Basic understanding of design patterns

---

## üéØ **Learning Path**
1. **Master Core DI** - Start with basic injection types
2. **Explore Design Patterns** - Learn pattern implementation with Spring
3. **Build Real Applications** - Practice with realtime projects
4. **Understand Bean Management** - Learn scopes and lifecycle
5. **Advanced Concepts** - Dive into i18n and dependency lookup patterns

---

Each folder contains a complete working project focused on a specific aspect of Spring IOC or related design pattern, making it ideal for systematic learning and practical implementation of Spring Core concepts.
