# IOC Projects

This folder contains Spring Core (IOC) concept-based mini-projects demonstrating various types of Dependency Injection and IOC design patterns:

### Core DI Concepts:
- **Setter Injection**: Using `@Autowired` annotation over setter methods.
- **Constructor Injection**: Using `@Autowired` annotation over constructors.
- **Field Injection**: Using `@Autowired` annotation directly on fields.
- **Ambiguity Resolution**: Resolving bean injection ambiguity using `@Qualifier`, `@Primary`, or `primary="true"` in XML-based configuration.
- **Dependency Injection (Maven Project)**: Demonstrating DI using a Maven-based setup.

### Design Pattern Projects:
- **Factory Pattern**: Demonstrates object creation using the Factory design pattern in a Spring context.
- **Strategy Pattern**: Demonstrates dynamic behavior injection using Strategy design pattern.
- **Strategy Pattern with Properties**: Strategy pattern implementation using externalized configuration.
- **Strategy Pattern with Spring**: Strategy pattern implementation managed via Spring container.

### Realtime & Advanced DI:
- **Realtime DI Test Project**: A mini-project simulating a real-world DI use case using Spring.
- **Realtime Student Registration**: Simulated registration flow using Spring beans and injection.
- **Student Registration with Mystyle**: Customized registration logic with Spring.
- **Bean Aliasing**: Demonstrates use of aliases for beans using `@AliasFor` and XML aliases.
- **Circular Injection**: Project showcasing how to identify and handle circular dependency injection issues in Spring.

Each folder contains a working Eclipse project focused on a specific aspect of Spring IOC or a related design pattern.

Let me know if you want a README for your **Spring Boot** or **JPA** project folders too.
