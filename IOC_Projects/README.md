# IOC Projects

This folder contains Spring Core (IOC) concept-based mini-projects:

- **Setter Injection**: Using `@Autowired` annotation over setter methods.
- **Constructor Injection**: Using `@Autowired` annotation over constructors.
- **Field Injection**: Using `@Autowired` annotation directly on fields.
- **Ambiguity Resolution**: Resolving bean injection ambiguity using `@Qualifier`, `@Primary`, or `primary="true"` in XML-based configuration.
- **Dependency Injection (Maven Project)**: Demonstrating DI using a Maven-based setup.

Each folder contains a working Eclipse project demonstrating a specific Spring IOC concept.
